# PentestNixOS
A bunch of packages for NixOS

## Why not upload these packages to Nixpkgs?

I don't really know how to package, and I don't want to upload these low quality packages for now.

## How to use it?

use it like `pentestNixos = pentestNixos.packages."${system}";`, place it near your unstable nixpkgs config in your flake config.
